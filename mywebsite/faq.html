		<summary>Do you recommand me a bar or pub ?</summary>
		<div class="faq__content">
			<p>You will find a lot of bars in Ireland, especially nearlly Temple Bar in Dublin. <br>
			But the best one in my eyes is the Murray's Pub in O'Connell Street Upper, Dublin. <br>
			There is a great atmosphere, the place is quite beautiful, the food is good and very good point the night you can assist to Irish dances and musics.</p>

		<summary>How is the weather in Ireland ?</summary>
		<div class="faq__content">
			<p>In Ireland it's rain a lot, it's also quite windy and there is a lot of humidity, so I recommand you to take warm and waterproof clothes. <br>
			No need for an umbrella with the wind it will broke in two days XD. <br>
			This weather can discourage but this permits to appreciate more the sunny day and also bar and coffee shop. <br>
			Most of the drink and food in Ireland keep warm very well.</p>
